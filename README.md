# upgrade_script
A simple script for lazy people for updating, upgrading and installing the latest updates on thier systems with some fancy prompt.

# !/bin/bash or intruduction
Please use this script wisely and be responsible with it. Note that using this script, the creator or anybody commiting to this script, is not responsable for any harm done to your system.

# Dependencies
this script is running on all systems that use apt-get, dpkg or aptitude. Each time the script is called I check for those 
applications.

# the variables 
I decided I wanted some fancy prompt to look at when I run this script. Deal with it. This script uses some variables but cleans them up afterwards just so I have a big bag of "I dont need this anymore".

# not root?
this script is only to use  for the system administrator. if there is an error or something happens that needs direct attention root is 
always there for you.

# ToDo !
- first time run show what its doing
- update the Dependencies section
