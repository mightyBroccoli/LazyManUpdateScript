A simple script for lazy people to run for updating, upgrading and installing the newest updates on thier systems with some fancy prompt...

# !/bin/bash or intruduction
Please use this script wisely and be responsible with it. Note that using this script the creator is not responsable for any damage done to your system.

# will this script run on my system ?
my script is running on all systems that use apt-get, dpkg and aptitude. each time the script is called I check for those applications.

# the variables 
I decided I wanted some fancy prompt to look at when I run this script. Deal with it. Then I needed some way to wrap all the old config files in one big bag of "I dont need this anymore".

# not root yet?
my script is only for the system administrator to use. if there is an error or something happens that needs direct attention root is always there for you.

# init.sh
This is a simple script I use for keeping the update.sh file on all my systems on the neweset version. Using the https connection to create and/or update an update.sh file.
